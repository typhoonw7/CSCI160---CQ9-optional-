# CSCI160---CQ9-optional-
Weighted Uniform Strings
- Time:
    -  The code itereate through the s which has n  element
    -  It itereate through the queries which has q element
    -  The toal time complexity is O(n+q)
- Space:
    - let q be the size of the queries
    - the set of w have a space of O(n) and since queries store the answer for each q; therefore, the total space complexity is O(n+q)

Mini-Max Sum
- Time:
    - we sort the arr of n element in the list
    - the loop iterate through the arr which n size
    - O(n log n)
- Space:
    - we store the answer in two variabvles
    - O(1)
